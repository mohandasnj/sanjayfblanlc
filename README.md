# FBLA Competitive Event: Coding & Programming Code Repository

> This computer program is built to manage the issuance of e-books to a class of students.

    Major functionalities includes
    The AP Statistics Book Tracker allows teachers to create an account, track and issue books to their class of students.

It also allows students to create an account, view issued books and run a report.
Five AP Statistics books have been chosen for the teacher to use.
The teacher can edit the book when they want to and then create multiple copies of that book. The teacher can then develop student accounts, and assign book copies to the students.

Additionally, the teacher can look at a weekly report of all the transactions that have occurred. This website provides a simple and easy way for teachers to give books to students & students to view their issued books.
Generate or print weekly report to show to whom books are assigned.
Used various control types including text boxes, drop down, buttons, nav bar, email, password, date picker, etc.
Appropriate validations were used where ever necessary.

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

You will need to create a keys_dev.js in the server config folder with

```
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'YOUR_OWN_MONGO_URI',
  secretOrKey: 'YOUR_OWN_SECRET'
};
```
